# Your challenge is to conduct an analysis to determine whether or not new renewable energy facilities enhance or hurt the electoral support of incumbent politicians in state legislatures. 
# You will get information about state election results for general elections in 2014-2020 in several states and information about the timing and location of large wind and solar projects during this same period.
# Your job is to build a dataset that measures 
# a) the change in electoral vote share for the incumbent party in each district election at the precinct level
# b) the incumbent party in the district (and precinct)
# c) the vote share for the incumbent party in the previous election 
# d) whether the candidate for election is the incumbent office holder
# e) whether a renewable project was built in the precincts between elections 
# f) whether the distrit had prior renewable energy facilities
# g) several demographic features in the district (like average income, % of minority voters, etc

#This project requires you to do several important data collection and managment tasks, drawing data from several sources (to be named), use spatial (shapefile) data, conduct and interpret 
#a statistical anlaysis, and provide a presentation laying out your results.
